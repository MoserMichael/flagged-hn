# Red Flagged Hackers News

This project is a crawler, website builder. It crawls [hackers news](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and puts information about each story in an sql table (postgress for that matter).
The point of the crawler is to display stories that were flagged, hence its name.

Here is the generated page [red flagged hackers news](https://mosermichael.github.io/flagged-hn/page_1.html)

The HN moderators are doing a good job, mostly - as you can see.

let's wait and see what the reaction at the proper HN will be...
